# Freestyle

## Welcome to the Freestyle DND LVL 1 Branch

### This is a much different branch from the Templates branch

Here you will need to undergo a few setups in order to play this game.


## SetUp

First clone this repository's branch and download it to wherever you wish. Desktop will work well.

Then you will need to create a virtual environment, or use the base environment

If you wish to create an environment use

```sh
conda create -n pygame-env Pytho=3.7 #first time only
conda activate pygame-env #after creation
```

next you need to install pygame to the environment

```sh
pip install pygame
```

This will allow you to run the game.

## Playing

To play the game use the command:

```sh
Python game/DNDLVL1.py
```

*This will likely be updated to a .exe eventually

Currently the player can move around for about 6 spaces or 30ft of movement

To get more movement hit End Turn on the bottom right.
Enemies will advance one space *this will likely be updated for enemy AI
